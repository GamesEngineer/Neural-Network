# Neural-Network
This is a Unity project for exploring neural networks. It is part of a class that is taught at Game-U.

This project contains the following scenes:
1. Point Classsifier 
1. Image Convolution 
1. Image Classifier

## Point Classifier Scene
The is a demonstration of a simple multi-layer neural network that is capable of classify 2D points as being either _inside_ or _outside_ of a set that is defined by a mathematical function.

## Image Convolution Scene
This is a simple demonstration of image convolutions (aka filters). It is used as a prerequisite to understanding convolutional neural networks.

## Image Classifier Scene
This is an interactive demonstration of a convolutional neural network that can recognize the images of handwritten decimal digits. After training, the user may draw a digit and the neural network will guess it.
